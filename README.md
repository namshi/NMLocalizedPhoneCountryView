## Installation

> Releases are Swift 4.2 compatible only.

### Cocoapods

`NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Simply add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView'
end
```

### Manual

1. Put `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` repo somewhere in your project directory.
2. In Xcode, add `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView.xcodeproj` to your project.
3. On your app's target, add the NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView framework:
   1. as an embedded binary on the General tab.
   2. as a target dependency on the Build Phases tab.

## Usage

If you're using `Storyboards/Interface Builder` you can create a `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instance by adding a `UIView` to your `Storyboard`, and then manually changing the view's class to `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` in the "Custom Class" field of the Identity Inspector tab on the Utilities panel (the right-side panel)

You can also create an instance of `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` programmatically:

```swift
import NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView

let cpv = NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView(frame: /**Desired frame**/)
```

#### Selected Country

To get the selected country from your `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instance at any time, use the `selectedCountry` property. 

```swift
let country = cpv.selectedCountry
print(country)
```
This property is not optional, the default value is the user's current country, derived from the device's current Locale.

#### States of selected country

You can also create see the list of states of your selected country.

```swift
let statesCount = cpv.selectedCountry.states.count
print("statesCount \(statesCount)")
```

#### Carrier-codes of selected country

You can also create see the carrier codes of your selected country, if any. The default is empty carrier codes array.

```swift
let carrierCodesCount = cpv.selectedCountry.carrierCodes.count
print("carrierCodesCount \(carrierCodesCount)")
```

#### Postal code of selected country

You can also see the Postal Code format for your selected country, if any. The default value is empty string.

```swift
let postalCodeFormat = cpv.selectedCountry.postalCode
print("postalCodeFormat \(postalCodeFormat)")
```

#### Changing locale of countries view

Change your app locale using 
```
cpvMain.localeSetup = NMLocaleSetup(baseLocale: sender.isOn ? "ar" : "Base", isRTL: sender.isOn)
```
and see the same list of countries in other locale. We've use Arabic locale in our demo project. 


#### Adding new locale for countries view

If you want to support new locale using this library, there are two ways:

####  1. Adding new locale in CountryCodes.json
Create a new PR and add new country locale in the json file of the original library.

e.g.
```
{
    "name": "United Arab Emirates",
    "name_ar": "الإمارات",
    "name_fr" : "Emirats Arabes Unis",  ---->> New locale
    "dial_code": "+971",
    "code": "AE",
    "postal_code": "",
    "carrier_codes": [],
    "states": []
}
```
####  2. Use your list of countries 
Instead of using the countries list provided in CountryCodes.json file, you can use your own countries list either locally or from any API response and use it to populate the CountryView.
Note: Make sure the response format is the same as the current one, as this structure is mandatory for the library to work.
If the response format of your custom-countries-API is not correct, or it has wrong/empty data, `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` will fallback to our local `CountryCodes.json` file. 
```
{
"name": "United Arab Emirates",
"name_ar": "الإمارات",
"dial_code": "+971",
"code": "AE",
"postal_code": "",
"carrier_codes": [],
"states": []
}
```

Note: If you've not added the translation for any country for a locale, it will show default name in English.

#### Exclude some countries from the main list

You can exclude those countries that you do not want to show in the main list as follows:

```
cpvMain.excludedCountriesList = ["AE", "QA", "SA", "OM", "KW", "BH"]
```
You have to pass the country codes of the excluded countries list in `excludedCountriesList` attribute of your countryView.

### Customization

Customization options for the view itself are available directly via the `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instance while options for the internal CountryView table view are available via the `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDataSource` protocol. Setting the `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDelegate` protocol is also necessary if you wish to be notified when the user selects a country from the list.

```swift
import NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView

class DemoViewController: UIViewController, NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDelegate, NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDataSource {

    @IBOutlet weak var localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    
        localizedPhoneCountryView.delegate = self
        localizedPhoneCountryView.dataSource = self
        
        /*** Direct customizations on NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView instance ***/
        
        // Show the selected country's phone(e.g +234) code on the view
        localizedPhoneCountryView.showPhoneCodeInView = true
        
        // Show the selected country's iso code(e.g NG) on the view
        localizedPhoneCountryView.showCountryCodeInView = true
    }
    
}
```

#### NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDelegate
The delegate function will be called when the user selects a country from the list or when you manually set the `selectedCountry` property of the `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView`

```swift
func localizedPhoneCountryView(_ localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView, didSelectCountry country: NMCountry) { 
	print(country)
}
```

#### NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewDataSource
The datasource functions define the internal(country list) ViewController's behavior. Run the demo project to play around with the options.

- An array of countries you wish to show at the top of the list. This is useful if your app is targeted towards people in specific countries.
  ```swift
    func preferredCountries(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> [NMCountry]
  ``` 
  
- The desired title for the preferred section. 
  ```swift  
    func sectionTitleForPreferredCountries(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> String?
  ```
  **Note:** You have to return a non-empty array of countries from `preferredCountries(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView)` as well as this section title if you wish to show preferred countries on the list. Returning only the array or title will not work. 
  
- Show **ONLY** the preferred countries section on the list. Default value is `false`
  ```swift  
    func showOnlyPreferredSection(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> Bool
  ``` 
  Return `true` to hide the internal list so your users can only choose from the preferred countries list. 
 
- The navigation item title when the internal view controller is pushed/presented. Default value is `nil`
  ```swift   
    func navigationTitle(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> String?
  ``` 
 
- A navigation item button to be used if the internal view controller is presented(not pushed). If nil is returned, a default "Close" button is used. This function only enables you return a button customized the way you want. Default value is `nil`
  ```swift    
    func closeButtonNavigationItem(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> UIBarButtonItem?
  ```
  **Note:** Any `target` or `action` associated with this button will be replaced as this button's sole purpose is to close the internal view controller.

- Desired position for the search bar. Default value is `.tableViewHeader`
  ```swift    
    func searchBarPosition(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> SearchBarPosition
  ```
  Possible values are: `.tableViewHeader`, `.navigationBar` and `.hidden`
 
- Show the phone code alongside the country name on the list. e.g Nigeria (+234). Default value is `false`
  ```swift    
    func showPhoneCodeInList(in localizedPhoneCountryView: NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView) -> Bool 
  ```
  
  #### FontTrait
  
  Define normal font family for your `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` and define `FontTrait` for your `UILabel`s inside `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` and `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewController` rows. Simplify override the values for  `selectedCountryFontTrait` and `countriesListFontTrait` for `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` and `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryViewController` respectively.
  
  Possible values for  `FontTrait` are:
  
```
  public enum FontTrait {
    case normal, bold, italic
  }
```
  
### Using NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView with UITextField

A good use case for `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` is when used as the left view of a phone number input field. 

```swift
class DemoViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var phoneNumberField: UITextField!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let cpv = NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 20))
        phoneNumberField.leftView = cpv
        phoneNumberField.leftViewMode = .always
    }
}
```
This means your users do not have to worry about entering the country's phone code in the text field. This also ensures you get a valid phone code from `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instead of relying on your users.

### Using the internal picker independently

If for any reason you do not want to show the default view or have your own implementation for showing country information, you can still use the internal picker to allow your users select countries from the list by calling the function `showCountriesList(from: UIViewController)` on a `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instance. 

It's important to keep a field reference to the `NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView` instance else it will be garbage collected and any attempt to use it will result to a crash.

```swift
class DemoViewController: UIViewController {

    // Keep a field reference
    let localizedPhoneCountryView = NMLocalizedPhoneCountryView()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
    
    @IBAction func buttonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
        localizedPhoneCountryView.showCountriesList(from: self)
    }
}
```
In the example above, calling `localizedPhoneCountryView.showCountriesList(from: self)` will result in the internal picker view controller being presented in its own navigation stack because `DemoViewController` is not a navigation controller. 

If you already have a navigation stack, you can push the internal picker view controller onto that stack by calling `localizedPhoneCountryView.showCountriesList(from: self.navigationController!)` or do it the safe way: 

```swift
if let nav = self.navigationController {
	localizedPhoneCountryView.showCountriesList(from: nav)
}
```
Don't forget to set a delegate to be notified when the use selects a country from the list. An example of how to use the internal picker view controller is included in the demo project.
